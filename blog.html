        <h2>Russian spy ship off US coast acting in ‘unsafe manner’</h2>
        <br>
        <p id="second"> 
             Russian spy-ship has returned to international waters off the southeastern coast of the United States and is operating in what two US officials told CNN is an “unsafe manner.”
            <br>
            <br>

                The Viktor Leonov, a Russian surveillance ship, has been sailing off the coast of South Carolina and Florida in the last few days, officials tell CNN, adding that the ship’s actions were determined to be unsafe because it is not using running lights in low visibility weather and it is not responding to commercial vessels’ attempts to communicate to avoid potential accidents.
                
                The official said the Vishnya-class spy ship was also engaged in “other erratic maneuvers.”
                
                A spokesperson for the US Coast Guard confirmed to CNN that the Coast Guard was broadcasting a “Marine Safety Information Bulletin” to alert mariners in the area to the Russian ship’s presence and its behavior.</p>

        <h2>US navy prepares allies to ‘protect navigation’ in Gulf</h2>
        <br>
        <p id="second">The United States is training Gulf allies to “protect navigation” in the region’s troubled waterways, as it seeks to build an alliance to contain Iran.
            <br>
            <br>

                Washington’s three-week International Maritime Exercise (IMX), which started on October 21, came after a number of commercial vessels were attacked in the Gulf from May, ratcheting up regional tensions.
                
                Washington and other Western powers blamed the incidents on Iran, which has denied any involvement.
                
                On Tuesday, the US invited international media to see part of the IMX, the second-largest maritime exercise of its kind.
                
                The manoeuvres involve 5,000 personnel, 40 vessels and 17 aircrafts from 50 countries deployed to the strategic waterway that separates Iran from the pro-US Arab Gulf monarchies.</p>
